# E-Commerce Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
## Project Description
This project aims to segment customers of an e-commerce platform into distinct groups using the K-Means clustering algorithm. By understanding customer behaviors and characteristics, the business can develop targeted marketing strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance overall business performance.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow the steps below to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/ecom-customer-segmentation.git
    cd ecom-customer-segmentation
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
If there is no requirements.txt file, the required libraries typically include:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Data
The dataset used for this project is sourced from [specify the source, e.g., a public dataset, internal company data, etc.]. It includes customer information such as:

- Customer ID
- Age
- Gender
- Annual Income
- Spending Score
- [Any other relevant features]

## Feature Engineering
Feature engineering involves transforming raw data into meaningful features that better represent the underlying problem to predictive models. In this project:

- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Scaling numerical features
- [Any other transformations]

## Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involves analyzing the dataset to summarize its main characteristics, often with visual methods. Key steps include:

- Univariate analysis (e.g., histograms, box plots)
- Bivariate analysis (e.g., scatter plots, correlation heatmaps)
- Identifying patterns and anomalies

## Modeling
The K-Means clustering algorithm is used to segment customers into distinct groups. Key steps include:

- Determining the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score
- Applying the K-Means algorithm to the dataset
- Visualizing the clusters

## Evaluation
Evaluating the clustering model involves:

- Analyzing the characteristics of each cluster
- Validating the consistency and distinctness of the clusters
- Using metrics such as Inertia and Silhouette Score

## Conclusion
bold textFrom the above Cluster analysis these are the following insights about each clusters: Among 30000 customers.
- Cluster 0 has 12432 customers (Very Low past orders but done most searches)
- Cluster 1 has 9128 customers (Very High past orders and average searches)
- Cluster 2 has 8440 customers (Average past orders and average searches)
- Cluster 0 has many customers but their past orders is only 7560.
- Cluster 1 is at the top based on past orders with 79885 orders which is more than 10 times of Cluster 0.
- Cluster 2 has least number of customers but has 37649 past orders which is almost 500% greater than cluster 0.
- Cluster 0 has done most number of searches with 81477 searches.
- Cluster 2 has least number of searches with 60093 searches followed by cluster 1 with 64573 searches.
## Results
- Description of identified customer segments
- Key characteristics and behaviors of each segment
- Business insights and potential strategies for each segment
